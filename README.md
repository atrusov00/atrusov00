- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arthur Trusov!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: (He/They)

I am an aspiring Machine Learning specialist. Here on my profile you can find projects I have done on a personal time, expect a lot of math.
In the past, I have worked as a program manager, product manager, and software engineering. Now, I have decided to specialize in machine learning partly due to
my interest in math. My graduate studies are currently being done at Columbia University, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
